# Your site

This is the team's website. It's a [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start)
app (React + Vite + Tailwind), served on **port 3000**. It starts life as a simple
"coming soon" placeholder (the headline reads the business name from `site.json` at
request time), but it's a real full-stack framework — build it out into the real
site and grow it into a dynamic app without changing hosting or starting a second
server.

## Layout

```
src/
  routes/
    __root.tsx     # the HTML shell: <head>, fonts, global layout
    index.tsx      # the landing page ("/")
  styles/app.css   # Tailwind entrypoint + base styles
vite.config.ts     # serves on 0.0.0.0:3000
```

Add a page by creating a new file under `src/routes/` — e.g. `about.tsx` becomes
`/about`. Files are routes; the router is generated automatically.

## Publishing changes

After editing, run:

```bash
bun run publish
```

This rebuilds the site and restarts the server on port 3000. (Editing files alone
does not update the live site — you must publish.) It always takes over port 3000
from whatever is running there, so it's safe to re-run no matter who started the
current server. The server log is `.run/server.log`.

## Making it dynamic

The site is static today, but adding backend behavior is one file away — no second
process, no extra port, all served on the same port 3000:

- **Server function** — call server-only code (DB, secrets, fetch) directly from a
  component:

  ```tsx
  import { createServerFn } from "@tanstack/react-start";

  const getMessage = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
    return { message: "Hello from the server" };
  });
  ```

- **API route** — add `src/routes/api/<name>.ts` for a REST endpoint.

Run `bun run publish` after either, and the dynamic behavior is live.
